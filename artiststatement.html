<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<h2><b>Biography</b></h2>
<p>
  I'm a Sacramento based artist who currently studies Digital Media Art student at San Jose State University.  I have been passionate about art for most of my life. I've enjoyed working in various fine art mediums, such as watercolor painting, drawing, and some charcoal.  I've also gained a passion for digital art over the past few years and enjoy working on projects, such as graphic design pieces and digital collages.  One of my favorite mediums to work with, however, is photography and have been practicing it for a very long time.
